To make this blogger clone work, you must have to allow subdomains in your localhost and point it to your root directory, and watch my lecture to create the wildcard subdomain in localhost.
if you are trying to upload it your live web server, then you must have a domain with wildcard subdomains enabled and pointed it to your website root folder and the add your domain into init.php and all javascript files and the php classes and other files as well, search for MyBlogger and replace with your domain.
